# Horiseon - Improving Website Accessibility

## Description

### What is it about?
Horiseon is a marketing agency providing social solution services. They are specialized in search engine optimization, online reputation management and social media marketing.

They requested a review of their website in order to:
1. improve the accessibility aspect of the website
2. refactor the code base

### Why is web accessibility important?

- **Inclusion** Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies (such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards). 
- **Wed positioning** Accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. 
- **Business** It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

## User story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

```
WHEN I open the web page, 
THEN I can clearly identify its structure using assistive technologies. 

WHEN I click on a link, 
THEN I'm redirected to its associated target.

WHEN I can't see an image,
THEN I can have access to an alternative text.

```
